Formidable is an **almost completely** strictly typed form library for PHP 7 and 8. Why only almost? Because we are missing
generics in PHP still, which would be the requirement to make it completely strictly typed. As soon as those are
available, Formidable will be updated accordingly.

## Installation

Install via composer:

```bash
$ composer require vardumper/formidable
```

## Documentation

Documentation builds are available at:

You can also build the documentation locally via [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org):
